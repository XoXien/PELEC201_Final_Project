            <h2>“Face-to-face”</h2>
            <p>
                For clients who love hands-on collaboration, our face-to-face meetings provide an opportunity
                to connect deeply. You can explore event concepts up close, timeline, and checklist while
                building a genuine relationship with our team. These meetings are often filled with laughter,
                excitement, and creative exchange — moments that help us craft events that truly reflect
                your personality and style.

            <h2>“Virtual”</h2>

            <p>
                For clients who prefer the comfort of their homes or are based outside
                Quezon Province, we offer virtual meetings that are convenient,
                efficient, and just as personal. Through online consultations, we 
                discuss your event goals, theme inspirations, budget considerations,
                and timelines — all while making sure communication stays clear,
                organized, and enjoyable.
